# hello-world
Just a test to see how this site works.\n
Hi everyone!\n
I'm a french student 15 years old, I just started learning java 3 months earlier and I'm a fan of coding.\n
I tried html but it's not in my field of interests yet.\n
I already have some skills in java because I'm learning it using openclassroom.\n
I'm also not that bad at writing English.\n
Thanks for reading this and feel free to ask me some help.
