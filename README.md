# hello-world
Just a test to see how this site works.</br>
Hi everyone!</br>
I'm a french student 15 years old, I just started learning java 3 months earlier and I'm a fan of coding.</br>
I tried html but it's not in my field of interests yet.</br>
I already have some skills in java because I'm learning it using openclassroom.</br>
I'm also not that bad at writing English.</br>
Thanks for reading this and feel free to ask me some help.
